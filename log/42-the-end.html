<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"></span><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I 
set out on this adventure primarily to sate my desire for broadening my sailing 
experience. The UK’s coast was an easy choice due to close proximity, much 
natural beauty and wanting to experience parts of Britain and coastline that I 
had not visited in person. The secondary goal was as a fundraising exercise for 
charities associated with sailing.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">This second goal has been 
achieved, though I would have to say requiring some determination. Had this not 
been an aim I would probably have looked for a cheap mooring up on the west 
coast of Scotland and left Ardent there for the winter, returning to enjoy this 
spectacular sailing area in this coming year. The down side of that plan would 
have been the constant worry about leaving a boat somewhere so far from reach, 
let alone the cost implication of doing so. So bringing Ardent home again has 
been good, even if only to rectify problems from wear and tear and alleviate 
worry.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The charity issue has 
circled around in the back of my mind for some time. Had I simply donated the 
money spent on this trip straight to charity they would have been better of by a 
factor of five! I would, however, have been the poorer for 
experience.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">It need hardly be said that 
coastal sailing can be challenging, even in reasonable weather. I guess that it 
is a bit like driving - the more you do the more confident you become. I have no 
qualms now about setting sail for anywhere around these coasts and what would 
have seemed like a major trip to me a year ago now appears like a weekend 
jaunt!</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I have been asked what part 
of the coastline would I class as my favourite. That would be an unfair question 
to answer as I have spent much more time in some parts than others and in quite 
varying weather conditions. The jewel that stood out on this trip though would 
have to be the Scillies. This is not just because it is an area that I love and 
know well but also because that week, by chance, heralded the best week of 
weather of the 2008! I was also in the company of two very close friends, and 
what more could you ask for than a beautiful location, fine weather and good 
friends? A few weeks later I was very much alone sailing around Scotland and I 
was pleased to find that I coped with my own company without problems or too 
many arguments (though I did have a tendency to talk a lot to myself or any 
other creature – fish/dolphin/bird that would listen). I would have to say that 
this part of the trip was made so very much easier by the continual stream of 
support that arrived in the form of emails, text messages and phone calls from 
so many friends whom I would sincerely thank.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Regrets? Very few. I do wish 
that I had had time to make the passage out to see St. Kilda off the far west of 
the Hebrides, but this must be anticipated in a future trip, along with the 
Shetlands! Hardware wise I was repeatedly convinced that the expenditure on an 
AIS transceiver and a SeaMe radar transponder was a good move. Not only did this 
technology assist me in good decision making when plotting a course amongst 
shipping but gave me the confidence that they should know I was there. Of 
course, I would regard reliable self-steering as part of the basic necessities 
for single handed sailing and both my hydraulic Autohelm and Hydrovane performed 
as hoped.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Ardent is now on the hard at 
GYC while I repair a stern-tube leek that progressively worsened over the last 
couple of months of the trip. I already have an itch to get her back in the 
water and head downstream in some of these beautiful January days. However, that 
won’t be achieved for a month or two yet.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Compiling and analysing the 
data both recorded from the navigation system and of costs and expenses incurred 
on the trip has been a long job but the results are interesting. The ‘tracker’ 
web page</span></span><span lang="en-gb"> </span><a href="../tracker.html"><span lang="en-gb"></span><span lang="en-gb"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">http://aroundardent.com/tracker</span></span></span><span lang="en-gb"></span></a><span lang="en-gb"></span><span lang="en-gb"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> now shows my course exactly in a minute by minute log (with a few gaps 
in data that have been approximated). If you click on any part of the track you 
can see a note of which hop of the journey it is and the date and time of that 
hop.

revelation into what costs a trip like this can incur. Don’t 
look if big numbers frighten you, as they have me! Naively I did not anticipate 
anywhere near this expenditure, but a large part of the costs was funding the running maintenance needed with such heavy use of an old boat. Included, however, is the cost of the engine rebuild, done 
hastily the month before departure having found major problems, as well as all the costs incurred enroute up until my 
return to Greenwich.</span></span></span></p>
