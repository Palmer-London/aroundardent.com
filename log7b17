set out on this adventure primarily to sate my desire for broadening my sailing 
experience. The UK’s coast was an easy choice due to close proximity, much 
natural beauty and wanting to experience parts of Britain and coastline that I 
had not visited in person. The secondary goal was as a fundraising exercise for 
charities associated with sailing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;This second goal has been 
achieved, though I would have to say requiring some determination. Had this not 
been an aim I would probably have looked for a cheap mooring up on the west 
coast of Scotland and left Ardent there for the winter, returning to enjoy this 
spectacular sailing area in this coming year. The down side of that plan would 
have been the constant worry about leaving a boat somewhere so far from reach, 
let alone the cost implication of doing so. So bringing Ardent home again has 
been good, even if only to rectify problems from wear and tear and alleviate 
worry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;The charity issue has 
circled around in the back of my mind for some time. Had I simply donated the 
money spent on this trip straight to charity they would have been better of by a 
factor of five! I would, however, have been the poorer for 
experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;It need hardly be said that 
coastal sailing can be challenging, even in reasonable weather. I guess that it 
is a bit like driving - the more you do the more confident you become. I have no 
qualms now about setting sail for anywhere around these coasts and what would 
have seemed like a major trip to me a year ago now appears like a weekend 
jaunt!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;I have been asked what part 
of the coastline would I class as my favourite. That would be an unfair question 
to answer as I have spent much more time in some parts than others and in quite 
varying weather conditions. The jewel that stood out on this trip though would 
have to be the Scillies. This is not just because it is an area that I love and 
know well but also because that week, by chance, heralded the best week of 
weather of the 2008! I was also in the company of two very close friends, and 
what more could you ask for than a beautiful location, fine weather and good 
friends? A few weeks later I was very much alone sailing around Scotland and I 
was pleased to find that I coped with my own company without problems or too 
many arguments (though I did have a tendency to talk a lot to myself or any 
other creature – fish/dolphin/bird that would listen). I would have to say that 
this part of the trip was made so very much easier by the continual stream of 
support that arrived in the form of emails, text messages and phone calls from 
so many friends whom I would sincerely thank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Regrets? Very few. I do wish 
that I had had time to make the passage out to see St. Kilda off the far west of 
the Hebrides, but this must be anticipated in a future trip, along with the 
Shetlands! Hardware wise I was repeatedly convinced that the expenditure on an 
AIS transceiver and a SeaMe radar transponder was a good move. Not only did this 
technology assist me in good decision making when plotting a course amongst 
shipping but gave me the confidence that they should know I was there. Of 
course, I would regard reliable self-steering as part of the basic necessities 
for single handed sailing and both my hydraulic Autohelm and Hydrovane performed 
as hoped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Ardent is now on the hard at 
GYC while I repair a stern-tube leek that progressively worsened over the last 
couple of months of the trip. I already have an itch to get her back in the 
water and head downstream in some of these beautiful January days. However, that 
won’t be achieved for a month or two yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Compiling and analysing the 
data both recorded from the navigation system and of costs and expenses incurred 
on the trip has been a long job but the results are interesting. The ‘tracker’ 
web page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aroundardent.com/tracker&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;http://aroundardent.com/tracker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt; now shows my course exactly in a minute by minute log (with a few gaps 
in data that have been approximated). If you click on any part of the track you 
can see a note of which hop of the journey it is and the date and time of that 
hop.

revelation into what costs a trip like this can incur. Don’t 
look if big numbers frighten you, as they have me! Naively I did not anticipate 
anywhere near this expenditure, but a large part of the costs was funding the running maintenance needed with such heavy use of an old boat. Included, however, is the cost of the engine rebuild, done 
hastily the month before departure having found major problems, as well as all the costs incurred enroute up until my

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;‘This will be my last northbound journey back to the boat’ I thought to myself as I headed from work to King’s Cross following my nightshift. I was again in high spirit despite lack of sleep from working. I was due to meet Jim from GYC who had actually, not just volunteered to come sailing in December in a leaking boat, but had taken leave from work to do so! How could I not be happy with such friends?&lt;br /&gt; We found Ardent as I had left her. Having missed the tide for that day we relaxed with a Chinese take-away. I was glad to have Jim as company, not just for his great companionship but also because the coming sail would undoubtedly be a long haul and staying awake and alert for 24 hours would be hard work on my own. We also had the benefit of meeting up with three members of the sailing club there, who advised as to the best times to hit the tide and informed us of a good stopping point at Lowestoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning saw us leaving through the open lock at 10:30 being so much easier to navigate in daylight. Humber VTS, who had been most helpful in advising ships of my presence on the way in, similarly kept in contact as we left. It was again apparent that our AIS signal, although seen by the coastguard, was unseen by the majority of ships who seemed only to have AIS transmitters! In my first communication with Humber VTS I realised that yachts with transponders must still be far and few between as they had assumed us to be a ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By lunchtime we were nearly 20 miles off land and halfway across the Wash. We decided not to dilly-dally, as we could not guarantee how long this break in the weather would hold. At 02:00 we were approaching Lowestoft and quickly located the waiting pontoon in the harbour. Being unconnected to land made it a safe roosting place for a population of gulls who were put out by our late night arrival. Six hours of sleep revived me enough to cast off again, much to Jim’s surprise as he emerged to find us leaving harbour with no chance to change his mind and escape! Within 36 hours of leaving Grimsby we had made good progress across the Thames estuary and were negotiating the wind-farm by the Isle of Sheppey. Punching the tide into the Swale, I not only felt on home ground but knew that I had at last closed the loop of the circumnavigation and that even if we sunk at this point my mission would have been accomplished! Anchoring at Harty Ferry gave us 3 hours rest, and while still in the swing we set off at high water to meander through the channel to Queenborough. I was glad to have made such progress as the weather talk from the coastguard had made me very aware of the strong winds that were following us down from the North. Once past the Thames safe water mark I felt confident that the weather was unlikely to stop us and indeed, having waited a couple of hours for the tide at Queenborough we made excellent progress up to Greenwich, reaching our voyage’s end at 16:30 at GYC.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

It seemed very achievable as I left, even giving me a couple of days to play with in case of bad weather or other problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

My bold approach to the harbour master this morning, to pay up my dues and leave, was greeted by one of those looks over his glasses as if to say ‘are you really sure?’ or ‘is this chap totally barking?’. Ironically the weather over the last 2 days has probably been comparable to the conditions encountered on route to Scarborough, winds up to 44 knots (severe gale) and seas to match! Of course, thinking back, I do remember considering that had I known that it was to blow up so much, so quickly, that I would not have chosen to go out! But worry not as tomorrow is another day and looks a little more promising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

If I can reach Grimsby tomorrow (59miles) and then the big one, an over-nighter to Great Yarmouth (99 miles), I’m in with a chance. Once at Harwich (52 miles) I am again in home territory, Queenborough being only 40 miles away, and home port Greenwich only a further 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I guess that is a result of the interesting mix of people&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;you meet while sailing, some very helpful, some brusque, some powerful, some incredulous. Tuesday was without doubt a high point, giving ideal sailing conditions and offering interesting encounters with boarders (check out the photo gallery).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

First noticed a mile astern, I guessed that she was either Navy or Customs as she has no AIS signal. Appearing seemingly from nowhere (though later I found that Valiant had a rear gate that could lower to release/recover this rib), a high speed rib appeared and having pulled alongside indicated that they would like to board. On greeting them it became apparent that they were a very different breed to the officious French Customs officers I have previously encountered. I left one to look about Ardent while chatting to the other about many subjects, including French Customs! Their visit was an uplifting meeting and a welcome interlude to the days sail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

I spotted the staggering flight of an exhausted small brown bird as he/she dropped onto the deck, then hopped onto the boom, hiding in the lea of the mail sail. I’m still uncertain of the breed, though it seemed most like a bedraggled Starling, though with a rather more brown hue (perhaps normal colouring for Starlings at this time of year - twitchers please respond). I offered ships biscuit and once energy was recovered he/she was off again, first to the mast top to admire the view and then away. My only other close encounter with wildlife on this leg was the whiskery face of a seal, spotted the previous day as it popped out alongside Ardent to say hello, but was clearly camera shy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The electronic birdcall simulator on the pontoons that constantly squawks day and night does nothing to discourage them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here I sit listening to the bird squawk loop and the wind howling, leaning the boat on her berth as hail ticks randomly on the cabin roof, begging that it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;blows itself out by tomorrow morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

However, the first words I heard were of a telephone conversation between the duty harbour officer and someone from Scarborough Yacht Club. It ran along these lines…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;‘No boats will be out today unless they are 40 meters plus. No, I’m sure the days racing will be cancelled. Goodbye.’ as the phone was hung up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;It is a difficult call to make at times, judging between advice given by others and your own gut feeling about the conditions. In the event I felt that as a blue water boat, if handled competently Ardent was quite capable of taking much harsher conditions than many would consider venturing out into, and I was happy that nothing too extreme would appear over the next 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Heading south I caught the best of the tide around Flamborough Head and down towards the Humber. The wind was favourable being on the beam until I crossed the shipping channel into the Humber where the ebbing tide and head wind, combined with a severe re-occurrence of fuel knock forced me to keep my revs low and meant slow progress to Fishdock No2 at Grimsby. The black moonless night contrasted by the plethora of lights on shore made identifying the lock entrance almost impossible without previous experience of it. Low tide made me extra cautious on my approach and indeed I went aground once before successfully scraping my way through the mud of the dredged channel into the lock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

One outstanding job begged to be done now and by 22:30 I had fitted a complete spare set of injectors on the Perkins engine. I had had enough of trusting that the fuel knock would work itself off, needing to know that the engine could be relied upon. I had almost forgotten how easily she started and how sweetly she ran and the pleasure was worth the oily hands and smell of diesel!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

Having checked that the dialup camera was working, John, one of the three harbour masters at the Humber Cruising Association kindly took me to the station in Grimsby. I was extremely thankful to him and his colleagues for keeping an eye on Ardent over the next three weeks and also for being kind with the charges. I could not have wished for a better support at this point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;I am now sitting in Scarborough, having been here for 2 days, frustrated by predictions of gales and strong wind warnings. My bold approach to the harbour master this morning, to pay up my dues and leave, was greeted by one of those looks over his glasses as if to say ‘are you really sure?’ or ‘is this chap totally barking?’. Ironically the weather over the last 2 days has probably been comparable to the conditions encountered on route to Scarborough, winds up to 44 knots (severe gale) and seas to match! Of course, thinking back, I do remember considering that had I known that it was to blow up so much, so quickly, that I would not have chosen to go out! But worry not as tomorrow is another day and looks a little more promising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;So there is hope yet. If I can reach Grimsby tomorrow (59miles) and then the big one, an over-nighter to Great Yarmouth (99 miles), I’m in with a chance. Once at Harwich (52 miles) I am again in home territory, Queenborough being only 40 miles away, and home port Greenwich only a further 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I guess that is a result of the interesting mix of people&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;you meet while sailing, some very helpful, some brusque, some powerful, some incredulous. Tuesday was without doubt a high point, giving ideal sailing conditions and offering interesting encounters with boarders (check out the photo gallery).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

First noticed a mile astern, I guessed that she was either Navy or Customs as she has no AIS signal. Appearing seemingly from nowhere (though later I found that Valiant had a rear gate that could lower to release/recover this rib), a high speed rib appeared and having pulled alongside indicated that they would like to board. On greeting them it became apparent that they were a very different breed to the officious French Customs officers I have previously encountered. I left one to look about Ardent while chatting to the other about many subjects, including French Customs! Their visit was an uplifting meeting and a welcome interlude to the days sail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

I spotted the staggering flight of an exhausted small brown bird as he/she dropped onto the deck, then hopped onto the boom, hiding in the lea of the mail sail. I’m still uncertain of the breed, though it seemed most like a bedraggled Starling, though with a rather more brown hue (perhaps normal colouring for Starlings at this time of year - twitchers please respond). I offered ships biscuit and once energy was recovered he/she was off again, first to the mast top to admire the view and then away. My only other close encounter with wildlife on this leg was the whiskery face of a seal, spotted the previous day as it popped out alongside Ardent to say hello, but was clearly camera shy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Here in Scarborough harbour, the pontoons are plagued by flocks of gulls, both common and lesser black backed with a fair number of a small brown backed, white-breasted bird, as yet unidentified. The electronic birdcall simulator on the pontoons that constantly squawks day and night does nothing to discourage them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here I sit listening to the bird squawk loop and the wind howling, leaning the boat on her berth as hail ticks randomly on the cabin roof, begging that it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;blows itself out by tomorrow morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

However, the first words I heard were of a telephone conversation between the duty harbour officer and someone from Scarborough Yacht Club. It ran along these lines…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;‘No boats will be out today unless they are 40 meters plus. No, I’m sure the days racing will be cancelled. Goodbye.’ as the phone was hung up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;It is a difficult call to make at times, judging between advice given by others and your own gut feeling about the conditions. In the event I felt that as a blue water boat, if handled competently Ardent was quite capable of taking much harsher conditions than many would consider venturing out into, and I was happy that nothing too extreme would appear over the next 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Heading south I caught the best of the tide around Flamborough Head and down towards the Humber. The wind was favourable being on the beam until I crossed the shipping channel into the Humber where the ebbing tide and head wind, combined with a severe re-occurrence of fuel knock forced me to keep my revs low and meant slow progress to Fishdock No2 at Grimsby. The black moonless night contrasted by the plethora of lights on shore made identifying the lock entrance almost impossible without previous experience of it. Low tide made me extra cautious on my approach and indeed I went aground once before successfully scraping my way through the mud of the dredged channel into the lock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

One outstanding job begged to be done now and by 22:30 I had fitted a complete spare set of injectors on the Perkins engine. I had had enough of trusting that the fuel knock would work itself off, needing to know that the engine could be relied upon. I had almost forgotten how easily she started and how sweetly she ran and the pleasure was worth the oily hands and smell of diesel!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

Having checked that the dialup camera was working, John, one of the three harbour masters at the Humber Cruising Association kindly took me to the station in Grimsby. I was extremely thankful to him and his colleagues for keeping an eye on Ardent over the next three weeks and also for being kind with the charges. I could not have wished for a better support at this point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The wind, a strong southwesterly, allowed us to motorsail down the coast, making good progress in bright sunshine. All looked well until I noticed that the bilge pump, which cut in from time to time for 30 seconds, had been on for rather longer. Lifting the floor showed a shocking amount of water in the bilge, with the drive coupling fountaining water upwards. 15 minutes of frantic pumping revealed water spraying up from around the stern tube flange. This looked like a boat beaching exercise to fix, so a quick call to Stonehaven harbourmaster, 6 miles to Starboard, secured a place against the harbour wall and I duly informed the coastguard. 30 minutes later we were told that the Stonehaven MRI had been launched to guide us in to port. This rescue RIB duly appeared alongside and we were greeted in Stonehaven by a concerned and friendly group, interested to know our woes and to know if they could help. A closer inspection found that the fast ingress of water was in fact caused by a pipe fracturing, which had by this time completely come adrift, pumping water into the boat faster as the engine speed increased. This was a copper pipe installed while in Southampton to water feed the new cutlass bearing and it had been in my mind to fit a stop cock here. So now was the perfect time. My selection of plumbing fittings was dug out and a ball valve with steel pipe was installed, so much the stronger - a job I was pleased with! This complete we decided to treat ourselves to a meal in the local restaurant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;2 hours later, feeling replete, we returned to find that Ardent had changed her mind and had laid down to port, despite being tied to lean towards the harbour wall. The harbour almost dry, we scrambled on board to try and catch some sleep lying at a very strange angle. The feeling was akin to being quite drunk (so I am told) whilst trying to negotiate our way through the cabin at such a strange angle. The bonus is that I now know that Ardent will happily sit on her side and right again with no ill effect, and I now know that she prefers to lean to port!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We left happily in the morning having been let off harbour charges and headed south again for the Forth. Another glorious and bright but fresh day with a strong SW wind enabled us to make good speed. We were delighted with our progress, motorsailing with the reefed main tight and seas constantly washing across the deck. As we approached the Tee estuary, just north of the Forth, the engine died. A quick inspection found water in the fuel filter. So, in dipping seas, while Colin manned the helm, I put my head down the bilge again, bled the fuel system and changed the fuel filter. I knew how difficult the Perkins can be to restart after fuel problems and this was no exception. 2 hours later and with 3 of the 4 batteries exhausted from trying to start her I gave up. Following a quick confab, we decided that of the two options asking for a tow was the safer, as the alternative to sail back north and seek shelter behind a headland could be problematic considering the forecast of impending gales. So, prudence being the better part of valor, I called the coastguard and requested a tow. The Anstruther (pronounced ‘Anstra’ I’m told) lifeboat mustered in an amazing 12 minutes and appeared about 40 minutes later. The RNLI preferred operation is to transfer a man onto the casualty, i.e. Ardent, before taking in tow. The sun had set and the wind had picked up to a strong 6. From the Anglo Saxon expletive issued on landing by the crew, chosen from the 7 on board to make this jump, I guessed that this had been an interestingly challenging maneuver! Alec turned out to be a great fellow, cheerful and supportive and assured me that I had done the right thing as this was his job and that he would far rather do it now that in worse conditions when perhaps lives would be at greater risk. I was totally overwhelmed by the RNLI response that evening. We had been lucky that it was their training evening with many helpers available. There were 7 crew on the Mersey class, a further 3 that appeared in an inflatable at the harbour entrance (looking like Borg with red light implants strapped to the left of their heads) and a further group of maybe 8 on the harbour wall bearing fenders. Their help extended to the morning when I found that my engine still did not want to turn properly, despite the batteries being on shore charge over night. Their tractor and a long pair of jump leads materialized and Stephen (&lt;/span&gt;fisherman come &lt;span&gt;RNLI Cox) demonstrated his diagnostic skills and eventually got the engine running. Then, he ferried me to the local garage with the engine battery for testing. The battery proved to be fine and further checking back on Ardent found the Vetus shore charger to be faulty, another £280 to spend for a replacement!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The weather that day kept us in port but we were not sorry to spend time in this delightful town. It exuded a friendly and helpful atmosphere and everything about the place looked smart and cared for. The evening culminated in the fish and chip shop, renowned for the coveted 'fish and chip shop of the year' 2006/2007, and I have to say that I don't think that I have had a better fish meal from a take away before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The next day, Friday, saw gentle winds of 12 knots. We grabbed the chance of making the 26 mile journey to Port Edgar and left again with hopeful spirits. Gales were forecast again for Saturday, so we wasted no time, engine on full and the mainsail up, more for stability than assistance as the wind was due west. Our speed of 5 knots hardly reduced as the wind picked up and up and up over the course of 3 hours. To my amazement it peaked at 38 knots, not far off a severe gale, the wind whistling in the rigging and the wave tops combed into white foam. I was glad to be only in an estuary and not right out at sea. But still we made good speed. The only incident of concern was a call by the Forth coastguard checking on any boats in that area. As we were the only one within sight I radioed in our position and our status as all well. This check call was a result of an overzealous member of the public who had reported a yacht in distress, and flashing a Morse SOS message! I was thankful that I had heard the coastguard call and that the lifeboat had not been scrambled to investigate. Arriving at Port Edgar at last gave a sense of achievement, but the problems continued. A check of the bilge found that the steel replacement pipe had fractured and water was again intruding. After some food we regained the strength and enthusiasm to tackle this problem again and fabricated a shorter connection. Then a quick trip around the marina almost cost me my mobility. In the toilet area, in the gloom of dusk I stepped down a concrete step to find that there were two steps. As I lay on the floor gasping in pain, I wondered if my ankle was broken and if there was enough power left in my mobile to call for help. However, after 5 minutes I recovered enough to hop back to the pontoons and Ardent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Investigation on Saturday found that the chandlers did not stock any electrical items due to a local agreement with the onsite electrician. Unfortunately he had gone home early, so the only way to get a replacement shore charger was to go out to Edinburgh. The charger had become imperative since finding that there was a small weep on the stern tube where it met the bulkhead, fixable only by a lift out. So, we decided to hire a car for this shopping trip and for the journey back to London. The 3 mile taxi ride to the airport to get the car stung us for £15! Then we thought we were going to be foiled at the last hurdle as we asked at first National then Avis to be told that they had no cars available. Fortunately, Budget still had a couple, so we were saved! A trip to Halfords succeeded in buying a suitable high powered charger. Unfortunately, on returning to the boat we found it to be faulty, displaying an F5 error! Returning the 10 miles to Halfords found that their stock records showing 2 more was incorrect and we were directed to another store 8 miles further on to pick up the replacement. Success at last and the batteries were on charge. The integrity of the boat while left was dependant upon the bilge pump working. I was not happy to leave without an auxiliary pump and switch, supplied by another battery and charger system. I had a spare pump but no spare float switch. Then inspiration struck and I removed the switch from the shower tray outlet pump which would be unused while away. Of course, it had gone faulty, the closed contacts measuring 5M ohms. What did I expect? Not to be deterred I set about making a float switch out of anything that I could find. One old toggle switch, piece of ply, copper pipe, spring, string and floating lamp later a monster emerged. Of course, this toggle switch was also faulty but being from another generation it could be opened up and cleaned. The results are a fishing line hanging into the bilge from the bent piping with the lamp as bait. If the water rises, the floating lamp rises and the pipe lifts by pressure from the spring. The switch operates and the pump activates.

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The drive home to London was uneventful until trying to deliver the car back at Heathrow. There we found that Budget's operation was not 24 hours and stopped at 23:00. So return was deferred until the morning, which involved a 06:00 start to battle the 3 hour queues back around the M25 to drop the car off at 09:00 before work!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The wind, a strong southwesterly, allowed us to motorsail down the coast, making good progress in bright sunshine. All looked well until I noticed that the bilge pump, which cut in from time to time for 30 seconds, had been on for rather longer. Lifting the floor showed a shocking amount of water in the bilge, with the drive coupling fountaining water upwards. 15 minutes of frantic pumping revealed water spraying up from around the stern tube flange. This looked like a boat beaching exercise to fix, so a quick call to Stonehaven harbourmaster, 6 miles to Starboard, secured a place against the harbour wall and I duly informed the coastguard. 30 minutes later we were told that the Stonehaven MRI had been launched to guide us in to port. This rescue RIB duly appeared alongside and we were greeted in Stonehaven by a concerned and friendly group, interested to know our woes and to know if they could help. A closer inspection found that the fast ingress of water was in fact caused by a pipe fracturing, which had by this time completely come adrift, pumping water into the boat faster as the engine speed increased. This was a copper pipe installed while in Southampton to water feed the new cutlass bearing and it had been in my mind to fit a stop cock here. So now was the perfect time. My selection of plumbing fittings was dug out and a ball valve with steel pipe was installed, so much the stronger - a job I was pleased with! This complete we decided to treat ourselves to a meal in the local restaurant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;2 hours later, feeling replete, we returned to find that Ardent had changed her mind and had laid down to port, despite being tied to lean towards the harbour wall. The harbour almost dry, we scrambled on board to try and catch some sleep lying at a very strange angle. The feeling was akin to being quite drunk (so I am told) whilst trying to negotiate our way through the cabin at such a strange angle. The bonus is that I now know that Ardent will happily sit on her side and right again with no ill effect, and I now know that she prefers to lean to port!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We left happily in the morning having been let off harbour charges and headed south again for the Forth. Another glorious and bright but fresh day with a strong SW wind enabled us to make good speed. We were delighted with our progress, motorsailing with the reefed main tight and seas constantly washing across the deck. As we approached the Tee estuary, just north of the Forth, the engine died. A quick inspection found water in the fuel filter. So, in dipping seas, while Colin manned the helm, I put my head down the bilge again, bled the fuel system and changed the fuel filter. I knew how difficult the Perkins can be to restart after fuel problems and this was no exception. 2 hours later and with 3 of the 4 batteries exhausted from trying to start her I gave up. Following a quick confab, we decided that of the two options asking for a tow was the safer, as the alternative to sail back north and seek shelter behind a headland could be problematic considering the forecast of impending gales. So, prudence being the better part of valor, I called the coastguard and requested a tow. The Anstruther (pronounced ‘Anstra’ I’m told) lifeboat mustered in an amazing 12 minutes and appeared about 40 minutes later. The RNLI preferred operation is to transfer a man onto the casualty, i.e. Ardent, before taking in tow. The sun had set and the wind had picked up to a strong 6. From the Anglo Saxon expletive issued on landing by the crew, chosen from the 7 on board to make this jump, I guessed that this had been an interestingly challenging maneuver! Alec turned out to be a great fellow, cheerful and supportive and assured me that I had done the right thing as this was his job and that he would far rather do it now that in worse conditions when perhaps lives would be at greater risk. I was totally overwhelmed by the RNLI response that evening. We had been lucky that it was their training evening with many helpers available. There were 7 crew on the Mersey class, a further 3 that appeared in an inflatable at the harbour entrance (looking like Borg with red light implants strapped to the left of their heads) and a further group of maybe 8 on the harbour wall bearing fenders. Their help extended to the morning when I found that my engine still did not want to turn properly, despite the batteries being on shore charge over night. Their tractor and a long pair of jump leads materialized and Stephen (&lt;/span&gt;fisherman come &lt;span&gt;RNLI Cox) demonstrated his diagnostic skills and eventually got the engine running. Then, he ferried me to the local garage with the engine battery for testing. The battery proved to be fine and further checking back on Ardent found the Vetus shore charger to be faulty, another £280 to spend for a replacement!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The weather that day kept us in port but we were not sorry to spend time in this delightful town. It exuded a friendly and helpful atmosphere and everything about the place looked smart and cared for. The evening culminated in the fish and chip shop, renowned for the coveted 'fish and chip shop of the year' 2006/2007, and I have to say that I don't think that I have had a better fish meal from a take away before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The next day, Friday, saw gentle winds of 12 knots. We grabbed the chance of making the 26 mile journey to Port Edgar and left again with hopeful spirits. Gales were forecast again for Saturday, so we wasted no time, engine on full and the mainsail up, more for stability than assistance as the wind was due west. Our speed of 5 knots hardly reduced as the wind picked up and up and up over the course of 3 hours. To my amazement it peaked at 38 knots, not far off a severe gale, the wind whistling in the rigging and the wave tops combed into white foam. I was glad to be only in an estuary and not right out at sea. But still we made good speed. The only incident of concern was a call by the Forth coastguard checking on any boats in that area. As we were the only one within sight I radioed in our position and our status as all well. This check call was a result of an overzealous member of the public who had reported a yacht in distress, and flashing a Morse SOS message! I was thankful that I had heard the coastguard call and that the lifeboat had not been scrambled to investigate. Arriving at Port Edgar at last gave a sense of achievement, but the problems continued. A check of the bilge found that the steel replacement pipe had fractured and water was again intruding. After some food we regained the strength and enthusiasm to tackle this problem again and fabricated a shorter connection. Then a quick trip around the marina almost cost me my mobility. In the toilet area, in the gloom of dusk I stepped down a concrete step to find that there were two steps. As I lay on the floor gasping in pain, I wondered if my ankle was broken and if there was enough power left in my mobile to call for help. However, after 5 minutes I recovered enough to hop back to the pontoons and Ardent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Investigation on Saturday found that the chandlers did not stock any electrical items due to a local agreement with the onsite electrician. Unfortunately he had gone home early, so the only way to get a replacement shore charger was to go out to Edinburgh. The charger had become imperative since finding that there was a small weep on the stern tube where it met the bulkhead, fixable only by a lift out. So, we decided to hire a car for this shopping trip and for the journey back to London. The 3 mile taxi ride to the airport to get the car stung us for £15! Then we thought we were going to be foiled at the last hurdle as we asked at first National then Avis to be told that they had no cars available. Fortunately, Budget still had a couple, so we were saved! A trip to Halfords succeeded in buying a suitable high powered charger. Unfortunately, on returning to the boat we found it to be faulty, displaying an F5 error! Returning the 10 miles to Halfords found that their stock records showing 2 more was incorrect and we were directed to another store 8 miles further on to pick up the replacement. Success at last and the batteries were on charge. The integrity of the boat while left was dependant upon the bilge pump working. I was not happy to leave without an auxiliary pump and switch, supplied by another battery and charger system. I had a spare pump but no spare float switch. Then inspiration struck and I removed the switch from the shower tray outlet pump which would be unused while away. Of course, it had gone faulty, the closed contacts measuring 5M ohms. What did I expect? Not to be deterred I set about making a float switch out of anything that I could find. One old toggle switch, piece of ply, copper pipe, spring, string and floating lamp later a monster emerged. Of course, this toggle switch was also faulty but being from another generation it could be opened up and cleaned. The results are a fishing line hanging into the bilge from the bent piping with the lamp as bait. If the water rises, the floating lamp rises and the pipe lifts by pressure from the spring. The switch operates and the pump activates. The power supply and Halfords charger are positioned such that a videocall made to a mobile mounted in the cabin shows that all is on charge and well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Part 2 of this journey begins with the conclusion of a holiday within a holiday in leaving the Caledonian Canal. This tranquil diversion was epitomized by the courteously greeted at the final canal lock, where my arrival, anticipated via the lockkeepers grapevine (Ch47) was further sweetened by the enticing offer of a cup of tea whilst waiting for the train bridge to swing. This personal and professional enthusiasm and pride for the Canal was apparent from west to east and left no doubt in my mind as to the value of the transit pass I had bought. Warnings also followed about the wind at the following exposed sea lock. This was no exaggeration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;The weather forecast has not been renowned for accuracy this summer as a complex stream of low pressure systems have brought unpredictable conditions. I have been using a US program called Grib, which displays wind states around the chosen area in a beautifully graphic wind vector map which, as a sailor and illiterate engineer, I find easy to interpret. These forecasts in the short term have generally been very accurate, until now. The 15 knot NE wind materialized as a 25 knot easterly. After an hour battle I decided that persistence was futile and took refuge at Fortrose, hijacking one of the yacht club moorings for the night. My thanks to them, if they ever read this, as I was unable to find a telephone contact for them and unprepared to risk a choppy ride in the inflatable for the half mile to shore. However, the next day, my enthusiasm still undampened I struck on for Burghead as the wind was a manageable 20 knots and had backed to NE. With luck the foretold backing would continue and prove a useful wind over the next few days to round the headland and bare away south. Wrong again. Evening time saw me tired and frustrated after six hours battling a head wind that was ultimately broaching force 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;My experience of the Harbourmasters along this coastline has been exemplary. When they have been too busy to answer the phone I have received a callback to enquire if they could help. Once my journey purpose had been established two of the harbours waved their charges, a touching gesture that lifted my sagging spirit. Entrance to many of these little harbours can be confidence challenging, especially on a dark moonless night with a strong onshore wind. Again, my electronic navigation was a boon and memorizing the harbour entrance essential. At Whitehills the harbour wall was all but invisible until twenty feet from it, and having turned the sharp left around the occulting red light I found myself hurtling down an apparent narrow blind alley towards a lifeboat slip! My memory however, not renowned for persistence, served true as I held my nerve and located the unseen gap in the wall at the end. Once negotiated the trauma evaporated to the peace of sheltered waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;My fourth and final NE corner on this square-dance around the coast beckoned. At last I had a sailing wind and made good headway the sixty five miles to Peterhead. The three hourly coastal weather reports from the coastguard stations were again liable to disruption due to industrial action so my next decision hung by a hair. The last received weather report had suggested strong winds due in twenty four hours, turning into a couple of days of gales. Not embracing the prospect of strong southerly winds let alone gales on the east coast I did not know whether to make a break for Arbroath, a further seventy miles and twelve hours journey, or plump for a reasonable nights sleep at Peterhead with the chance to recheck the forecast in the morning. The appeal of a nightshift evaporated at the last moment and the morning forecast suggested that leaving now would be a bad idea. This was reiterated by a call back from the Arbroath Harbourmaster who informed me that the last locking time into the harbour was at 19:45. So I was stuck in Peterhead, home of many of HMs inmates and undisputed heroine capital of the UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;So brings this short chapter to its early conclusion as I come to terms with yet another wind driven decision. The reality of work beckons on Monday, so I am cutting my losses and heading back to the big smoke, to return again when I can bribe/steal/cajole more leave from my enduring colleagues to continue this madness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;It seems inevitable in my life that whatsoever I plan, I miscalculate the amount I can fit in to the time allotted. However, fate has also not been helpful in terms of the weather. Excuses aside, perhaps the lesson here is to think of a number and double it to allow for anomalous conditions!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;My introduction to Scotland was at Port Patrick, a day’s sail from the Isle of Man and harboring a Scottish ‘John Bayley’ (for those who know him). The gain in sailing north was that south coast prices were left as just a bad memory. The facilities may on occasions have been meager but the visual impact surely compensated. As I progressed further north the enormity of the Western Isles sailing ground began to dawn upon me. Perhaps even overwhelmingly so, as I had to suppress a mild panic in realizing that I just did not know where to start and would only be able to savor a morsel in the lime I had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Scotland can be transformed within minutes from an idyllic heaven to a dreary and forbidding place for a yachtsman, as the sun is extinguished and rain is driven into your face by a gusting fickle wind. This makes for challenging sailing when combined with tidal currents that, in places, exceed 8.5 knots, creating eddies that bubble then smooth the surface and threaten to spin the boat about. You can be driven by a force 5 wind behind you yet in the space of three minutes find that it has become an equally strong headwind. But for me I am still lured by the exquisite beauty of the mountainous backdrop to the sea, sweetened still further by the friendliness of the wildlife as dolphins, seals and birds come to investigate the lone stranger in their waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;By contrast the Crinan and Caledonian canals are gentile and easy travelling. They are a delight and jewel of the British Waterways and bring me to the end of part one of this voyage as the duty of work, weddings and ceremonies calls me temporarily back to the bedlam of London.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Keep your eye on the tracker for part 2, heading south down the east coast, hopefully in early September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;So I have instigated plan C. C is for Caledonian Canal. I came to terms some while back that the ambitious Shetland route was not going to be realized. Indeed, even St Kilda has sadly been left to another time.&lt;/span&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;It seems inevitable in my life that whatsoever I plan, I miscalculate the amount I can fit in to the time allotted. However, fate has also not been helpful in terms of the weather. Excuses aside, perhaps the lesson here is to think of a number and double it to allow for anomalous conditions!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;My introduction to Scotland was at Port Patrick, a day’s sail from the Isle of Man and harboring a Scottish ‘John Bayley’ (for those who know him). The gain in sailing north was that south coast prices were left as just a bad memory. The facilities may on occasions have been meager but the visual impact surely compensated. As I progressed further north the enormity of the Western Isles sailing ground began to dawn upon me. Perhaps even overwhelmingly so, as I had to suppress a mild panic in realizing that I just did not know where to start and would only be able to savor a morsel in the lime I had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;Scotland can be transformed within minutes from an idyllic heaven to a dreary and forbidding place for a yachtsman, as the sun is extinguished and rain is driven into your face by a gusting fickle wind.

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;By contrast the Crinan and Caledonian canals are gentile and easy travelling. They are a delight and jewel of the British Waterways and bring me to the end of part one of this voyage as the duty of work, weddings and ceremonies calls me temporarily back to the bedlam of London.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;So I have instigated plan C. C is for Caledonian Canal. I came to terms some while back that the ambitious Shetland route was not going to be realized. Indeed, even St Kilda has sadly been left to another time.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

&lt;h2 class=&quot;null&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;As you may have gathered from the log, or recent lack of it, Jeremy has had to return to business responsibilities. This has left me with the formidable task of trying to follow in his footsteps and provide my input into the log.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;I have always accepted that to have a boat and sail you must be a little mad. I guess that this would be doubly so for sailing on your own. However, there is a thrill, a mixture of fear, anticipation and excitement that motivates this urge. My first leg from Padstow, where Jeremy stepped ashore, was to the isolated beauty of Lundy. In this idyllic weather the solitude beckoned like a siren to the rocks, impossible to ignore and almost impossible not to follow. The rewards though were visiting dolphins, first spotted off the starboard bow who came to investigate and say hello, swimming around and under Ardent for some five minutes as we sailed. Shy seals sneaked a look from a distance and gannets dived vertically into the sea at great speed in their unique fishing style. As the wind picked up over the day the Atlantic swell would lift the boat high from behind then plunge you into a trough, blocking out the horizon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt;By contrast, having reached Milford Haven and being joined for a few days by Colin, we left for a 120 mile leg overnighter for the Isle Of Man. The wind was force 5-6 when we left but expected to ease and was fortunately a much needed southerly which would make the distance a speedy hop. At 23:30 the coastguard upgraded the proceeding strong wind warning to imminent gale force 8. Nowhere to hide, just keep going. The night was black, but the pounding rain that flattened the surface of the sea reduced visibility to just a dozen yards, the foam from our bow just visible from the illumination of the nav lights. Three times as we plunged through the darkness I heard the dismayed cawing of a seabird, probably a surprised Guillemot having taken refuge on the water, not expecting to be run down as we loomed out of the black and startled him from sleep. I was eternally thankful for the high tech assistance that I had installed in the form of AIS and active radar reflector. The helmsman’s job was exhausting work, constantly correcting the course which was best steered by wind instrument as visibility was zero. Happy but exhausted we arrived at the IOM and slept until lunch time!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium; font-family: book antiqua;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The harbourmaster, when called before arrival and asked about space had chuckled and said ‘Pontoons? What are they? We get a 14 foot swell in the harbour here in a strong westerly.’ Glad of the tyre that I carry I moored alongside a fishing boat that I had been assured would be staying put the next day, as was I, due to forecast gales!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Padstow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few hours en route from the Scillies to the west coast of Cornwall, the land lies beyond our visible horizon. Hours of peace in which, under a complacent sun, we move as one with the rhythmic swell of the ocean. Only the lines of  cargo vessels steaming north and south present any kind of danger - but they can be seen when still far off and  are easily avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sailing offshore in a small boat may seem  to the uninitiated as more adventurous and frightening than keeping the land in view; but it is the coast that fills sailors with apprehension and keeps them on their toes. At sea there are no rocks or sandbanks to circumvent, no headlands to round or lobster pots to avoid, no narrow entrances to negotiate or tides and depths to calculate. Even gales are easier to manage in mid ocean than near a coastline where steep seas may form over  shallows, and winds and adverse waves can drive vessels onto a lee shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today, no gale threatens and the south-westerly promised by the Met Office has emerged as a breathless drift. Our progress is slow and stately;   and in the afternoon heat, Ardent's  gentle  rocking  reduces us to a dozy silence that lasts until the sun glows red on the western horizon and  the evening chill stirs us into activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Padstow proudly announces itself as the largest harbour on the north coast of Cornwall - but the distinction derives its force from the absence of competition for there are no others of note.  The inner harbour is tiny and charming.  A &quot;downtown&quot;  pool -  surrounded on three sides by pubs, restaurant and shops, it  is managed  by an energetic harbourmaster who seems able by some sleight of hand to accommodate as many yachts and power cruisers as seek entry even when, to concerned onlookers like ourselves, there seems to be no room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a small fishing fleet operates from Padstow, the town is almost wholly given over to tourism. Locals complain that the season &quot;is one of the worst in living memory&quot;, but daytrippers nonetheless throng the narrow streets, the pubs and restaurants hum,  and the B&amp;amp;Bs are fully booked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many visitors have come 'en famille' and for the sake of the children must perforce ignore the glowering skies and misty rain -  both having returned - and brace themselves for a chilly cruise in the estuary or a windswept walk on the beach.  We are a hardy race in the matter of climate, and go about our pleasures with a steely determination to ignore discrepancies between the sun-filled blandishments of guidebooks and brochures - and the miserable reality of our island weather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am intrigued by the cross-section of  English hominids on view. Moulded in every size and shape available to the bi-pedal frame, they are dressed - with an endearing  lack of  self-regard - in ill-fitting summer livery: baggy,  calf-length shorts, nylon frocks, and parti-coloured t-shirts emblazoned with advertising slogans.   I remember Robertson Davies - the Canadian novelist  - remarking that the English don't give a damn what anyone thinks of them, a view  that Padstow's holidaymakers -  inelegant, unprepossessing,  and entirely unselfconscious -  seem content to confirm. Joining the crowd,  I am  bemused by our collective plainness (yes, I include myself). We are not a pretty sight.  But as I write these words, I remember  Thoreau's  reminder that the rawest humanity possesses a deep richness, no matter its outward appearance&lt;em&gt;. &quot;Though there are many crooked and crabbled specimens ,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; he writes,  &lt;em&gt;&quot;.....run all to thorn and rind, and crowded out of shape by adverse circumstances, like the third chestnut in the burr, ... yet fear not that the race will fail or waver in them; like the crabs which grow in hedges, they furnish the stocks of sweet and thrifty fruits still.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The quotation is from &lt;em&gt;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack&lt;/em&gt; - a work hardly anyone reads but which is every bit as fascinating as his more famous &lt;em&gt;Walden&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another side exists to Padstow:  thanks to one of Britain's most celebrated chefs it has become a gastronomic centre of international repute. Rick Stein - the chef in question - owns a good dozen businesses in town including several restaurants and B&amp;amp;B's, a small hotel, a delicatessen, a fish shop, and a bakery. A leaflet available at the tourist office lists them all and marks them on a map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a generous friend's invitation, we dined twice at Rick Stein's flagship which is known simply as &quot;The Seafood Restaurant&quot;,  and once on our own more modest account at his relatively downmarket fish-and chip shop. Both are expensive - the former extravagantly so, though the dining is memorable, the latter overpriced for fare that differs in flavour hardly at all from that of any half decent chippy except that Rick Stein's portions err on the thin side of minceur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great man's influence on Padstow must have been considerable. Several  other restaurants of quality have emerged to compete with his, and even those with  lower prices and less obvious appeal to gourmet tastes offer interesting menus and excellent cooking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do the locals feel about Mr Stein's success? Under questioning, one wondered if the town's name should not be changed to &quot;Padstein&quot; - but the remark came in a tone of mild amusement rather than resentment.  We heard no adverse comment - and the friendliness of the townsfolk and the welcome they offer to strangers suggest that they are not unhappy with their lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months after we set out, I have been called urgently back to work. I had been hoping at least to cross the Bristol Channel in Ardent, but once again the weather detained us and I could delay my departure no longer.  As I write, Ian has reached Milford Haven where he has been joined by a replacement crew member - Colin Robson.  Both are safe; but Ian tells me that the rain still falls and the wind continues to howl in the rigging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, then my log ends. I will not miss the self-exposure that literary effort demands however simple its message and restricted its readership; but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss the discipline, this being one of the few occasions in my life when I have managed to put into practice a lesson I learned many years ago from Chateaubriand  - but have heeded on the whole too lightly. Here, from his Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe (Memoirs from Beyond the Grave) is the passage, first in the original French and then in my own inadequate translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Notre existence est d’une telle fuite, que si nous n’ecrivons pas le soir l’événement du matin, le travail nous encombre et nous n’avons plus le temps de le mettre à jour. Cela ne nous empêche pas de gaspiller nos années, de jeter au vent ces heures qui sont pour l’homme les semences de l’éternité.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our existence is so fleeting that if, in the evening, we fail to record the day’s events, their sheer volume overwhelms us and we are no longer able to bring them to light. Even so we go on wasting our time, spending in idleness hours that for humankind are the seeds of eternity.“&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

A leaflet available at the tourist office lists them all and marks them on a map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a generous friend's invitation, we dined twice at Rick Stein's flagship which is known simply as &quot;The Seafood Restaurant&quot;,  and once on our own more modest account at his relatively downmarket fish-and chip shop. Both are expensive - the former extravagantly so, though the dining is memorable, the latter overpriced for fare that differs in flavour hardly at all from that of any half decent chippy except that Rick Stein's portions err on the thin side of minceur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great man's influence on Padstow must have been considerable. Several  other restaurants of quality have emerged to compete with his, and even those with  lower prices and less obvious appeal to gourmet tastes offer interesting menus and excellent cooking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do the locals feel about Mr Stein's success? Under questioning, one wondered if the town's name should not be changed to &quot;Padstein&quot; - but the remark came in a tone of mild amusement rather than resentment.  We heard no adverse comment - and the friendliness of the townsfolk and the welcome they offer to strangers suggest that they are not unhappy with their lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months after we set out, I have been called urgently back to work. I had been hoping at least to cross the Bristol Channel in Ardent, but once again the weather detained us and I could delay my departure no longer.  As I write, Ian has reached Milford Haven where he has been joined by a replacement crew member - Colin Robson.  Both are safe; but Ian tells me that the rain still falls and the wind continues to howl in the rigging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, then my log ends. I will not miss the self-exposure that literary effort demands however simple its message and restricted its readership; but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss the discipline, this being one of the few occasions in my life when I have managed to put into practice a lesson I learned many years ago from Chateaubriand  - but have heeded on the whole too lightly. Here, from his Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe (Memoirs from Beyond the Grave) is the passage, first in the original French and then in my own inadequate translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Notre existence est d’une telle fuite, que si nous n’ecrivons pas le soir l’événement du matin, le travail nous encombre et nous n’avons plus le temps de le mettre à jour. Cela ne nous empêche pas de gaspiller nos années, de jeter au vent ces heures qui sont pour l’homme les semences de l’éternité.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our existence is so fleeting that if, in the evening, we fail to record the day’s events, their sheer volume overwhelms us and we are no longer able to bring them to light. Even so we go on wasting our time, spending in idleness hours that for humankind are the seeds of eternity.“&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A touch of admiration in the speaker's tone as if the ideals of life were to be found further south - but that meanwhile Falmouth would do. My view? A charming enough place, with splendid sea views, clean air and enough restaurants and pubs to satiate the county. And  yet (perhaps there is always a &quot;yet&quot;), nothing about Falmouth would induce me to visit it for pleasure, and were I obliged, by some odd capriciousness of fate, to live there, I would probably at some early stage find myself entertaining suicidal thoughts.

We eschewed them in favour of the fallafels sold from a little booth on the mid-town quay by a young couple - he English, she Israeli:  a surprisingly authentic touch of the Middle East - flavours and sauces that briefly took me back to a little café near the gates of the old city of Jerusalem and to a long, unfinished personal odyssey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The harbour buzzes with activity - commercial vessels, yachts, fishing boats in ceaseless movement.

River cruise boats steam up and down at speed, shattering any illusion one may have woven of having eluded &quot;civilization&quot; - and no creek - however peaceful - escapes the attentions of the harbour commissioners of the city of Truro who levy a fee of five pounds on vessels anchored anywhere within their jurisidiction - including secluded areas wholly devoid of harbour facilities. On the east coast there are a thousand creeks and coves where yachts may anchor unmolested by harbour officials on the make.  Not so in the south where, it seems, no inch of coastal or riparian water remains that is not considered a source of revenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, in return for our money, the Harbour Master hands us  a bulky packet of pamphlets on the area and its wildlife. Five pounds worth of pulped rainforest perhaps....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scilly Isles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scillian life is conducted on a miniature scale. Of the inhabited islands, only St Mary's has enough houses and shops to qualify as a  town - though on the mainland it would probably merit no higher status than that of a prosperous village. On the other inhabited islands, a food store, a pub and maybe a hotel and some B&amp;amp;Bs account for most of the visible commercial life.  Clearly no one comes here for the shopping. And while the Scillies depend much on tourism for their economic well-being, effort is required to reach them, and visitors are not so numerous as to erode the sense the islands convey of being isolated and as far from the madding cares of the world as it is possible to get in the crowded land that Britons call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered at first if the Scillies are accessible only to the well-to-do. But it is not so, for there are discreetly-located campsites dotted among the hills where those who cannot afford the steep price of a cottage or a hotel room, can still enjoy the wild, craggy beauty of the land and sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes maybe an hour to stroll round the entire island of St Agnes.  En route, we came to the tiny church, very simple and dignified, with a wooden plaque on the wall opposite the altar listing the ships rescued and people saved by the now defunct St Agnes lifeboat crew.  The church stands in the middle of a  graveyard  shielded by box and juniper from the Atlantic winds. We read a few of the headstones - and then a few more. Three family names - two preponderantly - account for almost all the deaths - and thus the lives - of the inhabitants.  I tried to imagine myself living in a community where perhaps a third of the population - or even more - were blood relatives - but quickly chased away the thought as altogether too unpleasant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stood on the shore of Bryher at low tide and gazed across the thin strip of water towards Tresco.   To our right, a clutch of bilge-keel yachts stood upright high and dry on the sands. Before us, at the water's edge, more  boats squatted at odd angles, and still others further out sat quietly on their moorings. A few figures in the middle distance were wading through the water, though their movements were barely perceptible. All was still, with the stillness of a Dutch landscape,  as if time had stopped in its tracks, and the busy world left to drift in the ebbtide of memory. Yet the very peacefulness of the scene reminded me that the obverse of tranquillity is savagery, and I was conscious - how could it be otherwise? - of how exposed these low-lying islands must be to Atlantic storms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short walk or climb in almost any direction in the Scillies is rewarded by dramatic views of rocky peaks and islets.  Beautiful, even awe-inspiring, scenery exists in many parts of the world, however.  Much harder to find would be a garden such as the famous one in Tresco - a riot of  temperate and tropical vegetation with plants and trees from many parts of Europe, North and South America, South Africa and the antipodes. I was struck by the variety of luxuriant life, the profusion of species from different parts of the world that here rub shoulders without, it seems, ever coming into conflict, and by the thought that the rich diversity on view forms only a tiny sample - barely a sample - of all the flora that exist in the world. One can become lost in the Tresco gardens - not as in a labyrinth - but in contemplation of the lushness of our planet and at its mystifying fecundity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the garden is a small museum that has nothing to do with plants. It houses a collection of ship's figure heads - mermaids, elegantly-robed women, officers with swords at the ready, Turks with cloth head-dresses and so on - most of them rescued from ships driven by storms or steered by navigational error onto one of the Scillies' innumerable rocks. A reminder of the countless wrecks that surround these shores - and the dangers that lie in wait for inattentive sailors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

		<summary type="html">Salcombe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we entered Salcombe, the harbourmaster greeted us in his launch, escorted us to a mooring and took our line - a pleasant and courteous welcome marred at once when he informed us of the nightly charge - an eye-watering sum for a mere tie-up at a buoy. Salcombe itself is a pleasant enough village to the eye, but its wholesale dedication to serving tourists and the sailing community gives it a dull, monochromatic air. Expensive clothing stores outnumber all others, and the restaurants and pubs all charge the same high prices for the same food. Even the water taxi from boat to shore costs more than elsewhere. Marketing textbooks have it that businesses should charge &quot;what the market will bear&quot;; but in the end we found Salcombe's prices and its brazen appeal to human acquisitiveness disagreeable. Shopping is apparently the Western World's prime leisure activity - but I doubt there is any genuine pleasure available from buying things we neither need nor really want. &quot;Superfluous wealth,&quot; Thoreau reminds us, &quot;can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary for the soul.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fowey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a famous figure was born or lived there, some towns and villages punch well above their weight. Stratford would probably live in relative obscurity were it not for Shakespeare; Haworth owes its fame to the Bronte sisters; and while the Lake District holds it own in any company for its magnificent scenery, the lakeland village of Grasmere has become a place of pilgrimage simply because it hosts Wordsworth's Dove Cottage, which is no longer a dwelling but a shrine specialising in the great man's works and - together with the whole village - in whatever stationery, biscuits, fudge and general bric-a-brac can be associated with his name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little town of Fowey on the Cornish coast boasts two distinguished figures. One - Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch - an Oxbridge scholar and writer of the early twentieth century was and remains the most celebrated editor of the Oxford Anthology of English Verse. His  edition,  first published in 1900, arguably gave light to some hitherto buried treasures of our literary heritage, but more than anything it made him an arbiter of contemporary taste because the lesser poets he allowed to rub shoulders with the likes of Chaucer, Pope, Donne, Shakespeare and the great Romantics  entered the canon and became part of the Great Tradition, whilst those he left out suffered a distinct reversal of esteem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this may seem remote and irrelevant to the age in which we live. Even in his own day, Quiller-Couch's views on English poetry mattered to no more than a handful of the population,  and though his Oxford Anthology sold well, one suspects that far more people bought it than read it, and that many copies - bestowed as presents by well-meaning relatives or received as school prizes  - were left to gather dust on unvisited shelves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, we like to think ourselves arbiters of our own taste, free to chose our likes and dislikes and impervious to the dictats of those who presume to tell us what and how to be and do. We fool ourselves, of course. Countless Quiller-Couch's of the modern age from film directors, advertisers and marketers, to pop stars, fashion designers, teachers and ministers of state shape our views and choose much of what we see and hear. On the whole, the original Q-C didn't do a bad job - better, I suspect, than most of the literary gurus who've come after him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Arthur certainly isn't, and probably never was, a household name. Not so Fowey's other famous citizen - Daphe du Maurier. Her novels  are not, I admit, to my taste. I'm unable to suspend disbelief in her characters or the situations in which they find themselves, and her style seems to me like a literary form of hyperventilation, a sort of breathless, gothecised romanticism in which people, places and action are all overburdened with feverish meaning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, she was loaded with literary ability. And knowing how much work, emotion and self-doubt is involved in writing fiction, I am impressed - on visiting the &quot;Daphne du Maurier&quot; shop - at the sheer volume of her output. I can't help but admire her industry and her unquestioned way with words. And who am I to argue with the success of someone who has given pleasure to hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of readers?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, &quot;her&quot; shop didn't detain us for long, no more than any of the other small manifestations of the Du Maurier industry on display in town; though we noted with amusement that even highway signs include a parenthetical reminder that every direction leads to &quot;Du Maurier country&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fowey and Polruan on its opposite bank belong to the category of pretty Cornish ports  - all hills and narrow winding streets. Fine food, sightseeing cruises, canoes for hire, and dramatic coastline views draw tourists from land and sea. But tourism is one trade among several, for there are fishing and cargo vessels berthed in the harbour, the latter traditionally associated with the export of china clay. The varied working life of the town gives it a quiet dignity, a sense of hardy independence. Visitors, in consequence, receive a  friendly welcome but are never oppressed - as is so often the case in vacation resorts (and yacht harbours for that matter) - by constant, garish attempts to lighten their purse.And it's  not often you read in a grocer's window an irresistible offer like this:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Big Bag Carrots, Past Best, Free to a Good Horse.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We climbed to the outskirts of town and then uphill along a muddy path through woods that smelled of must and damp as they usually do in autumn.  Many of the trees - birch, alder, beech and sycamore - were ancient, coated in moss at ground level and rising at odd angles in response to the steep, rocky terrain. Alone of its kind, one stately mediterranean pine soared skyward - planted perhaps by a forgotten forefather of the town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerging from the forest, we skirted a field planted with maize and rounded  the gardens of a stately Victorian farmhouse before turning into a narrow lane bordered by a hedge on one side and on the other by an old drystone wall overgrown with bushes. Wild flowers in profusion on each side: brilliant golden dandylions, purple thistles, burdock, green ferns, anemones, white bindweed, and occasional sprays of elder and wild honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt; And then abruptly we found ourselves on a hill-side of open grassland looking down through swathes of mist at the sea and the rocky entrance of the harbour. On the hill to our right, a herd of cattle stood out like smudges of brown and white paint on a green canvas.  Ian walked down the hill towards the edge of the cliff and sat on a bench gazing seaward.  No one else in sight. Wet grass, a slight chill in the air, and fine raindrops falling lightly on the skin:  each of us was alone at that moment with our thoughts for company; and I remembered Shelley's lines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...........I love all waste&lt;br /&gt;And solitary places; where we taste&lt;br /&gt;The pleasure of believing what we see&lt;br /&gt;Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plaque on the brow of the hill informed us that the land had been bestowed on the town &quot;ïn perpetuity&quot;  by one of its citizens - and we were to see a couple similar signs both in Fowey and Polruan - gifts from wealthy landowners of panoramic parcels of countryside. Such gestures speak of citizenship and solidarity - qualities that elsewhere too often belong to a long-departed and maybe illusionary past, a time when people left their front doors unlocked, lost wallets and handbags were delivered intact to the local police station, and fortune and misfortune alike were shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A late supper at the Ferry Inn in Boddinick afforded us a different view of local life. As closing time approached, three men in their forties sat side-by-side on stools at the bar with pints of ale in front them. Occasionally they would take a brief, mechanical sip -  swallowing so little as to barely change the level of liquid in their glass. In so small a community - a mere handful of houses - they can't have been strangers, yet they neither spoke nor even acknowledged each other's presence. Nor did they stir as  the proprietor, a beautiful young woman, cleaned and tidied the counter before them. They looked unspeakably and profoundly tired - not with the fatigue that a full working day might bring - but with life itself - as if everything this world might once have offered them, the hopes, ambitions, dreams and joys, had drained away, leaving nothing that might raise a smile or prompt an exchange. We wondered if they sat there in order to escape an unhappy atmosphere at home, or whether they had come simply to be in the presence of the lovely girl who served them - though if the latter they kept their pleasure well hidden. They were still at the bar when we departed, sullen and stolid before their pint glasses, refusing to stir or answer when we bade them good-night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps all is not so well in Fowey and Polruan as meets the visitor's eye. No place is without heartache and disappointment.  But we found enchantment there, and sailed away with a faint, pleasurably melancholy sense of having seen too little and left too soon.</summary>

On the whole, the original Q-C didn't do a bad job - better, I suspect, than most of the literary gurus who've come after him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Arthur certainly isn't, and probably never was, a household name. Not so Fowey's other famous citizen - Daphe du Maurier. Her novels  are not, I admit, to my taste. I'm unable to suspend disbelief in her characters or the situations in which they find themselves, and her style seems to me like a literary form of hyperventilation, a sort of breathless, gothecised romanticism in which people, places and action are all overburdened with feverish meaning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, she was loaded with literary ability. And knowing how much work, emotion and self-doubt is involved in writing fiction, I am impressed - on visiting the &quot;Daphne du Maurier&quot; shop - at the sheer volume of her output. I can't help but admire her industry and her unquestioned way with words. And who am I to argue with the success of someone who has given pleasure to hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of readers?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, &quot;her&quot; shop didn't detain us for long, no more than any of the other small manifestations of the Du Maurier industry on display in town; though we noted with amusement that even highway signs include a parenthetical reminder that every direction leads to &quot;Du Maurier country&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fowey and Polruan on its opposite bank belong to the category of pretty Cornish ports  - all hills and narrow winding streets. Fine food, sightseeing cruises, canoes for hire, and dramatic coastline views draw tourists from land and sea. But tourism is one trade among several, for there are fishing and cargo vessels berthed in the harbour, the latter traditionally associated with the export of china clay. The varied working life of the town gives it a quiet dignity, a sense of hardy independence. Visitors, in consequence, receive a  friendly welcome but are never oppressed - as is so often the case in vacation resorts (and yacht harbours for that matter) - by constant, garish attempts to lighten their purse.And it's  not often you read in a grocer's window an irresistible offer like this:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Big Bag Carrots, Past Best, Free to a Good Horse.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We climbed to the outskirts of town and then uphill along a muddy path through woods that smelled of must and damp as they usually do in autumn.  Many of the trees - birch, alder, beech and sycamore - were ancient, coated in moss at ground level and rising at odd angles in response to the steep, rocky terrain. Alone of its kind, one stately mediterranean pine soared skyward - planted perhaps by a forgotten forefather of the town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerging from the forest, we skirted a field planted with maize and rounded  the gardens of a stately Victorian farmhouse before turning into a narrow lane bordered by a hedge on one side and on the other by an old drystone wall overgrown with bushes. Wild flowers in profusion on each side: brilliant golden dandylions, purple thistles, burdock, green ferns, anemones, white bindweed, and occasional sprays of elder and wild honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt; And then abruptly we found ourselves on a hill-side of open grassland looking down through swathes of mist at the sea and the rocky entrance of the harbour. On the hill to our right, a herd of cattle stood out like smudges of brown and white paint on a green canvas.  Ian walked down the hill towards the edge of the cliff and sat on a bench gazing seaward.  No one else in sight. Wet grass, a slight chill in the air, and fine raindrops falling lightly on the skin:  each of us was alone at that moment with our thoughts for company; and I remembered Shelley's lines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...........I love all waste&lt;br /&gt;And solitary places; where we taste&lt;br /&gt;The pleasure of believing what we see&lt;br /&gt;Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plaque on the brow of the hill informed us that the land had been bestowed on the town &quot;ïn perpetuity&quot;  by one of its citizens - and we were to see a couple similar signs both in Fowey and Polruan - gifts from wealthy landowners of panoramic parcels of countryside. Such gestures speak of citizenship and solidarity - qualities that elsewhere too often belong to a long-departed and maybe illusionary past, a time when people left their front doors unlocked, lost wallets and handbags were delivered intact to the local police station, and fortune and misfortune alike were shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A late supper at the Ferry Inn in Boddinick afforded us a different view of local life. As closing time approached, three men in their forties sat side-by-side on stools at the bar with pints of ale in front them. Occasionally they would take a brief, mechanical sip -  swallowing so little as to barely change the level of liquid in their glass. In so small a community - a mere handful of houses - they can't have been strangers, yet they neither spoke nor even acknowledged each other's presence. Nor did they stir as  the proprietor, a beautiful young woman, cleaned and tidied the counter before them. They looked unspeakably and profoundly tired - not with the fatigue that a full working day might bring - but with life itself - as if everything this world might once have offered them, the hopes, ambitions, dreams and joys, had drained away, leaving nothing that might raise a smile or prompt an exchange. We wondered if they sat there in order to escape an unhappy atmosphere at home, or whether they had come simply to be in the presence of the lovely girl who served them - though if the latter they kept their pleasure well hidden. They were still at the bar when we departed, sullen and stolid before their pint glasses, refusing to stir or answer when we bade them good-night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps all is not so well in Fowey and Polruan as meets the visitor's eye. No place is without heartache and disappointment.  But we found enchantment there, and sailed away with a faint, pleasurably melancholy sense of having seen too little and left too soon.</content>
